Principal Component Analysis:

Sometime data set has too many variables. May be, 100, 200 variables or even more.
In such cases, you can’t build a model on all variables.
Reason being,
    1) It would be time consuming.
    2) It might have lots of noise
    3) A lot of variables will tell similar information

Hence, to avoid such situation we use PCA a.k.a Principal Component Analysis.
It is nothing but, finding out few ‘principal‘ variables which explain significant amount of variation in dependent variable.
Using this technique, a large number of variables are reduced to few significant variables.
This technique helps to reduce noise, redundancy and enables quick computations.

    MULTI-CLASS CLASSIFICATION
    Refers to those classification tasks that have more than two class labels.

    Unlike binary classification, multi-class classification does not have the notion of normal and abnormal outcomes.
    Instead, examples are classified as belonging to one among a range of known classes

    Popular algorithms that can be used for mult-class classification include:
        . KNN
        . Decision trees
        . Naive Bayes
        . Random Forest
        . Gradient Boosting
